# Java EE on Azure
This repository shows the key ways of deploying a Java EE application to Azure. The repository hosts the demos for [this](abstract.md) talk.

The basic Java EE application used throughout is in the [javaee](/javaee) folder. 

Azure pathways for Java EE applications include:
* Deploying a Java EE application on Azure using IaaS. The [iaas](/iaas) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying a Java EE application on Azure using PaaS. The [paas](/paas) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying a Java EE application on Azure using Docker and Kubernetes. The [kubernetes](/kubernetes) folder shows how this is done.

The demos use Java EE 8, WildFly and Eclipse.
